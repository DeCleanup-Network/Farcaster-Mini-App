/**
 * DCU Points System
 * 
 * DCU Points are stored ON-CHAIN through the RewardDistributor contract's internal DCUToken contract.
 * 
 * How it works:
 * 1. RewardDistributor contract uses a DCUToken contract internally to track points
 * 2. When rewards are distributed (level claim, streak, referral, impact form), 
 *    the RewardDistributor calls dcuToken.mintReward() which transfers tokens from 
 *    the contract's rewards pool to the user
 * 3. User's DCU points balance = their balance in the DCUToken contract
 * 4. Points are stored with 18 decimals (like standard ERC-20 tokens)
 * 
 * Storage Location:
 * - On-chain: DCUToken contract (accessed via RewardDistributor.dcuToken())
 * - This file provides fallback localStorage functions for development/testing
